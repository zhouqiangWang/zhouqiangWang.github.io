Intro to Machine Learning. What is machine learningsemi-automated extraction of knowledge from data. two main categories of machine learning? supervised - predictive modeling, making predictions using data; unsupervised learning - extract structure from data or learning how to best represent data. two main steps of supervised learning: train a machine learning model using existing labeled data. make prediction on new coming data. video 2. set-up python environment for machine learningvideo 3. Exploring the Iris datasetMachine learning terminology observation : Each row in dataset(also known as: sample, example, instance, record); feature : Each column in dataset(aka. predictor, attribute, independent variable, input, regressor, covariate); response : Each value we are predicting(aka: target, outcome, label, dependent variable); Classification : supervised learning in which the response is categorical; Regression : supervised learning in which the response is ordered and continuous. Requirements for working with data in scikit-learn Features and response are separate objects; Features and response should be numeric; Features and response should be NumPy arrays; Features and response should have specific shapes. video 4.
